My work interests include applied bioinformatics, genomics, genetics and evolution. Data science and comparative genomics have been recurrent themes in my areas of work. A majority of my work has been on non-model species such as Rockfishes, European green lizards, Naked Mole Rats and Guinea pigs to name a few. The novelty of never before sequenced and the challenge of working with unfamiliar data excites me as a researcher.

I've been a computational genomics postdoc since 2019 at UC Berkeley in the Integrative Biology department mentored by [Prof. Peter Sudmant](https://www.sudmantlab.org/). My grad school training was at iDiv, University of Leipzig in the Informatics department guided by [Prof. Peter Stadler](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/peopleStadler.html). Majoring in Bioinformatics at universities in India (UoHyd and TNAU), I moved to the US to pursue my passion for research.<br><br>

My personal interests are video games, bouldering, hiking, photography ([Insta](https://www.instagram.com/rohitkolora/)) and board games. I love dogs (and cats), my SudFam niece calls me the dog whisperer.<br><br>
