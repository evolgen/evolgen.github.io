I have been a computational genomics postdoc since 2019 at UC Berkeley. I work in the Integrative Biology department with [Prof. Peter Sudmant](https://www.sudmantlab.org/). My grad school training was in iDiv, University of Leipzig in the Informatics department guided by [Prof. Peter Stadler](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/peopleStadler.html). My major at university was in Bioinformatics in India (UoHyd and TNAU).<br><br>

My work interests include applied bioinformatics, genomics, genetics and evolution. Data science and comparative geneomics have been recurrent themes in my areas of work. I have reviewed reseach articles for BMC Bioinformatics, GBE, Genes, MBE and PLoS journals.<br><br>

My personal interests are video games, bouldering, hiking, photography ([Insta](https://www.instagram.com/rohitkolora/)) and board games. I love dogs (and cats), my SudFam niece calls me the dog whisperer.
