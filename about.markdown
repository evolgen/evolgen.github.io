My work interests include applied bioinformatics, genomics, genetics and evolution. Data science and comparative ~Omics have been recurrent themes in my areas of work. I started my career on non-model systems gradually moving towards therapeutics and disease genetics. The novelty of never before studied and the challenge of working with unfamiliar data excites me as a researcher.

I am currently a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at the [Institute of Genomic Medicine](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/institute-for-genomic-medicine), where I leverage computational tools to uncover the origins, progression, and potential therapies for pediatric genetic diseases. My journey into industry research began at [Alector](https://alector.com/) in 2022, where I focused on age-related conditions such as neurodegeneration and cancer. 


Academically, I trained at UC Berkeley in the lab of [Prof. Peter Sudmant](https://www.sudmantlab.org/) and at the University of Leipzig under the guidance of [Prof. Peter Stadler](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/peopleStadler.html). I moved to the U.S. in 2019 to pursue my passion for research and innovation in genomics and computational biology.

My personal interests are bouldering, hiking, photography and board games. I love dogs (and cats), my SudFam niece calls me the dog whisperer.<br><br>
