Themes of my research include data science, computational biology, comparative- and phylo-genomics.

<h3>Comaparative genomics of phenotypic variation</h3>
All living systems age with passing time, making aging an interesting phenomenon across the tree of life. In animals, maximum lifespan is usually similar to body size. However, there are a few exceptional species which defy this pattern such as Humans, Bowerhead whales, Greenland sharks, Tortoises, Bats and Rockfishes. Rockfishes are exceptional models to uncover the secrets to longevity since rockfish live from 10-200 years, thus making them apt to study the genetic signatures of aging. Generating Rockfish genome assemblies and employing comparative phylogenomic methods, we identified genes and mutational signatures which are [The Causes and Consequences](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5332) of lifespan variaton.

<h3>Genome and transcriptome evolution</h3>
Selection pressure and mutation accumulation are the primary causes of genomic divergence leading to species evolution. Comparing genomes of closely related lacertid species, we found signatures of structural evolution and selection leading to [species evolution](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/2/giy160/5237706). These signatures of evolution leading to divergence are mainly seen in a [tissue-specific manner](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/13/8/evab109/6275683) as witnessed from their transcriptomes.

<h3>Computational methods for Disease evolution</h3>
Structural changes in the genome lead to disease phenotypes. Detecting [structural variation](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007933) and [disease causing genetic variants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037020304360) can help identify causes and develop therapeutic targets against diseases.
