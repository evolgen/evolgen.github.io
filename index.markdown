<h4>Hi there wanderer!</h4>

My current research is in the therapeutic space, aiming to discover targets and help develop therapies against genetic diseases. A Computational biologist by training, I'm fascinated by the ~Omics of living systems. For my [Research](/research/), I develop and apply computational methods to demystify biological processes.<br>
