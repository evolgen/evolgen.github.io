<h4>Hi there wanderer!</h4>

I'm [Rohit](/about/) (he/him), currently a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley exploring the genomics of aging. A Computational biologist by training, I'm fascinated by the ~Omics of living systems. For my [Research](/research/), I develop and apply computational methods to demystify biological processes.<br>

<br>Live long and prosper - like [Rockfish](./images/rockfish_symbol.png)!!!
